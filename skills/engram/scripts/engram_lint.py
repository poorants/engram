"""engram integrity linter (knowledge-network linter).

Scans every markdown document under the current repo's PARA base and reports
integrity problems AND network-shape (neural density) metrics.

  1. Broken links
     - Markdown relative link `[text](relative/path.md)` pointing to a file that
       does not exist (error).
     - Wikilink `[[name]]` that matches no file (warning — may be a future note
       not created yet).
  2. Orphan nodes
     - A document that receives no inbound link from any other document.
  3. Weak nodes (lonely spokes) — the "connected but not woven" signal
     - A document whose ONLY inbound links come from MOC/hub files (README,
       index, …). It passes the orphan check but is just a folder spoke: it is
       reachable by a single path (its folder), so the graph is a star, not a
       brain. A MOC link is necessary but not sufficient; a node becomes woven
       only when a content document links it (ideally across a folder boundary).
       Weak nodes are advisory warnings, surfaced in --json always and in the
       human report under --all. (See linking-rules: "no lonely spokes".)
  4. Density metrics — woven_ratio, cross-folder + hub edge ratios, indeg
     histogram. These quantify how neural the network is, beyond pass/fail.

The engram skill (the intelligence) calls this script (the shared muscle),
parses the result, and repairs the network by reconnecting broken links, adding
contextual links to orphans, and weaving lonely spokes into the wider network
(see the Weave Workflow and scripts/weave_candidates.py).

PARA base auto-detection (the skill runs at the target repo root = cwd):
  - brain/ is the default base for BOTH standalone vaults and code projects; the
    root holds repo meta and any exported/published output.
  - If brain/ exists -> nested mode, base = brain/.
  - Else if para/ exists -> nested mode, base = para/ (legacy, back-compat).
  - Else if the root contains projects/ areas/ resources/ archives/ -> flat mode,
    base = root (a legacy standalone vault).
  - Else -> assume brain/ (silent if missing).
  - Override with `--base PATH`.

Usage (from the target repo root):
    python <skill>/scripts/engram_lint.py            # human report (silent if clean)
    python <skill>/scripts/engram_lint.py --json     # machine JSON (skill parses)
    python <skill>/scripts/engram_lint.py --base .   # force base (root)
    python <skill>/scripts/engram_lint.py --all      # print summary even when clean

Exit code is always 0 (non-blocking). Wikilinks may point to future notes
(Obsidian convention), so problems are reported but never block work.
